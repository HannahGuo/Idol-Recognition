The original program I wrote that uses key presses - see the bottom of main.py for usage. Instead of using a tkinter window, it uses the console (but still shows a window with the processed image)

This was much more experimental (less polished) and is probably easier to try out then for me to explain. 

See the [main README.md](https://github.com/HannahGuo/Idol-Recognition/blob/main/README.md) for more information.
